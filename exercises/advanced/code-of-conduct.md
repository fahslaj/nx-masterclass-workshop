# Code of Conduct

`Nx Masterclass Workshop` is a friendly workshop where everyone should feel welcome, safe and comfortable to learn, share ideas and engage in open discussion without threat of intimidation or public embarrassment. Please be respectful in person and on social media towards other attendees, trainers, and staff.
We are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of anyone in any form.

Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for the venue, including breaks. Workshop participants who violate these rules may be expelled from the workshop (without a refund) at the discretion of the organisers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of trainers or attendees or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. These policies apply in every space at the venue related to workshop activity, and to all participants in every role.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please let us know immediately. We will be happy to assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the workshop, for example by providing escorts or contacting police should this be required.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all all times.zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
